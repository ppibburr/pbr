About
===
Provides FileSystem, IO and GUI features to mruby using:  
* GLib
* Gtk
* Soup
* WebKitGTK+

Where an attempt has been made to expose a more ruby-style interface to those libraries.

Setup
===

Changes need to be made to the source tree and not the file `./mrblib/pbr.rb`  

After changing run  
`ruby ./setup.rb` 
This will remake the file `./mrblib/pbr.rb` 

Then rebuild mruby
